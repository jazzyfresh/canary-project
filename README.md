### The Canary Project is 
The Canary Project is a qualitative, procedural algorithm
by which you can identify and remedy toxic company culture.

This project is built by people who truly believe
that it is a moral imperative to be inclusive in the workplace
and that doing so will also make our businesses more competitive
in the local and global market.

Currently, it is just a collection of READMEs,
but in the long-term, we are hoping to build real software
that can help companies identify and remedy toxic culture.

### The Canary Project is not
A one-size-fits all solution. Actually, that's kind of the point:
we live in a diverse world and have diverse experiences and challenges.
This project was made from the point of view of the contributors who built it,
but it is lacking many other perspectives. We hope this project is extensible enough
to be a working foundation that anyone can use to identify and overcome challenges
related to diversity and inclusion. We encourage you to contribute and improve this
project, please fork our repository and submit a pull request!
